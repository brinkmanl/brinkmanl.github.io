        <h2>Past</h2>
        <p>I began my work experience in customer service with the Missouri Department of Revenue. I answered
            correspondence and worked with taxpayers visiting the office to resolve past-due balances. I learned quickly
            the ability to deliver information in a clear, positive manner is a skill. </p>

        <p>I've worked in Information Technology for over 20 years and have experience helping users make their
            day-to-day activities more efficient and increase accuracy. After all of the various roles I've filled, I
            have decided that the two things I love most about my job are working with customers to develop a system to
            make their lives easier and following up afterward to ensure the system meets their needs and looking for
            ways to improve it even more. </p>

        <h2>Present</h2>
        <p>I take the approach of teamwork. I encourage working together to resolve an issue. No one should ever feel
            alone, without someone to turn to for guidance or a different perspective. My friends and family often tease
            me for my empathetic approach to life. I often make up a story about a person I encounter to help me
            remember I may not be seeing them at their best. A driver cut me off because they were rushing home to a
            sick child. The waitress wasn't providing optimal service because her boyfriend just broke it off. Using
            this approach in my daily life allows me to remember we are all humans and face unseen and unspoken
            challenges. We all need to treat one another with respect and care. We need to work together for the greater
            good of our society.</p>

        <h2>Future</h2>
        <p>With my background in customer service, experience in volunteer training, and knowledge of developing web
            applications, professional development is a logical next step. I enjoy the challenge of making difficult
            tasks easy and breaking big projects down into manageable chunks for simple execution. I look forward to
            this new opportunity in my career.
