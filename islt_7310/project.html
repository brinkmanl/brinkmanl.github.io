            <p>As a database programmer for the University of Missouri, I support various

                accounting
                system that has significantly decreased manual entry integrating the system with PeopleSoft for county
                invoicing. I
                support several legacy systems and continually work with users to find ways to make their jobs easier

            <p>My employment with Mapping Your Future allowed me to expand my information technology skills. I was

                for
                most information technology systems and decisions throughout my employment. I not only developed web
                applications,
                but I also developed databases, maintained optimal server environments, and supported various staff

                their
                roles. Throughout my employment, I was consulted to create marketing materials, presentation materials,

                and supervision of independent contractors. I continued as an Independent Contractor for four years
                after

            <p>The Booneslick Trail Quilters' Guild is the oldest quilting guild in Mid-Missouri, beginning in 1978. I
                joined the guild to improve my quilting and network with other fiber artisans. I have formed valuable
                friendships and had numerous opportunities to support the organization. Since the guild is a 501(c)3
                non-profit
                organization, part of the mission is to educate and support our community. We have donated hundreds of
                quilts
                and
                spread the knowledge of this pastime at various events around the central Missouri area. I have been
                personally
                involved
                in creating and collecting over 100 quilts donated annually to an Easter basket project for foster
                children
                since 2020.</p>

            <p>I filled various roles for Girl Scouts during my nine years of involvement. After becoming the Troop
                Leader
                for
                my
                stepdaughter's troop, I was asked to be Service Unit Team Manager. I enjoyed that role, as it allowed me
                to
                support and
                educate Troop Leaders in our area. I was asked to represent our area as part of various focus groups and
                was
                even part
                of an expert panel at a Council-wide leader training. While volunteering with the organization, I
                maintained
                a
                blog to
                provide information to leaders worldwide on ways to fulfill badge requirements and increase involvement.
                Girl
                Scouts will
                forever have a special place in my heart and fulfilled my desire to help others and give back to our
                community.</p>
