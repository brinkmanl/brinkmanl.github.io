        <h2>Who I Am</h2>

        <video src="LoraBrinkman-My Intro.mp4" controls class="youtube-video"></video>

        <p>My name is Lora Brinkman. I live in Columbia, Missouri. I have been married to Chris for 18 years. I have a
            stepdaughter, Callie. We have a Shiba Inu, Niko, and a Siamese cat, Fast Eddie.</p>

        <h3>Where I've Been</h3>
        <p>I have worked in Information Technology for over 20 years. I have developed both websites and web
            applications. I began my career as an application programmer. I then worked for a small non-profit
            organization as a web application developer. I started working at the University of Missouri in 2019 as a
            database programmer. In 2020, I decided to further my education. I received a Bachelor of General Studies
            from the University of Missouri <em>(M-I-Z!)</em> in May 2023.</p>

        <h3>What I Do</h3>
        <p>I am currently working on a Master of Learning Technology and Design degree. I have a YouTube channel, Lora B
            Flosstube. I share various craft ideas, give tips and tricks, and attempt to utilize learning techniques to
            help viewers improve their skills. I have been improving the quality of information shared on my channel
            with learning techniques discussed in the graduate classes I am taking. I enjoy quilting and
            cross-stitching. I'm involved with a local quilters' guild. I enjoy supporting the community through
            charitable efforts. I enjoy going to the gym for stress relief. My husband and I love live music, fine
            dining, and car shows. These activities bring happiness and balance to my life.</p>

        <h3>Favorite Quote</h3>
        <blockquote><em>"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where
            the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,
            whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and
            again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the
            deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the
            best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails
            while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know
            victory nor defeat."</em><br>
            â€• Theodore Roosevelt</blockquote>
