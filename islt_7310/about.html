       <h2>About me</h2> 
       <p><a href="Brinkman-resume.pdf">My resume</a></p>

        <p>I live in Columbia, Missouri. I have been married to Chris for 18 years. I have a stepdaughter, Callie. We have a Shiba Inu, Niko, and a Siamese cat, Fast Eddie. I have a YouTube channel, Lora B Flosstube. I share various craft ideas, give tips and tricks, and <em>attempt</em> to utilize learning techniques to help viewers improve their skills.  I have been improving the quality of information shared on my channel with learning techniques discussed in the graduate classes I am taking.</p>
    
        <p>I have worked in Information Technology for over 20 years. I have developed both websites and web applications. I began my career as an application programmer. I then worked for a small non-profit organization as a web application developer.  I started working at the University of Missouri in 2019.</p>
        
        <p>In 2020, I decided to <em>continue</em> my education. I completed a Bachelor of General Studies at Mizzou in May 2023. I am currently working on a Master of Learning Technology and Design degree.</p>
        
        <p>I enjoy quilting and cross-stitching. I'm involved with a local quilters' guild. I enjoy supporting the community through charitable efforts. I  enjoy going to the gym for stress relief. My husband and I love live music, fine dining, and car shows. These activities bring happiness and balance to my life.</p>

        <h4>Favorite Quote</h4>
        <blockquote>"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."<br>
        â€• Theodore Roosevelt</blockquote>
